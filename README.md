# Notes and Questions from ML book

**Chapter 1 : The Machine Learning Landscape**

1. What is supervised learning? Name some most important supervised learning algorithms?
```diff
+ In supervised learning, training set has label information of inputs. 
+ Some algorithms name as: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forests, 
+ Support Vector Machine(SVM), k-nearest neighbours, Some neural networks.
```

2. What is unsupervised learning? Name some most important unsupervised learning algorithms?
```diff
+ In unsupervised learning, training data is unlabelled.
+ Clustering(K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis(HCA)), Anomaly Detection and novelty Detection
+ (One-class SVM, Isolation Forest), Visualization and dimensionality reduction ( Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
+ Kernel PCA, Locality Linear Embedding(LLE), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding(t-SNE)), Association
+ Rule Learning(Apriori, Eclat)
```

3. What is association rule learning?
```diff
+ Through association rule learning, we discover interesting relations between attributes in large amounts of data.
```

4. What is semisupervised learning?
```diff
+ In which data are partially labeled
```

5. What is reinforcement learning?
```diff
+ In this learning, agent learns from the environment, select and perform actions and get rewards(punishment) in return. 
```

6. What is batch learning(offline learning)? What are the disadvantages in it?
```diff

```

```diff
- text in red
+ text in green
! text in orange
# text in gray
@@ text in purple (and bold)@@
```
